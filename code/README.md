# Movie project
By Sara Carlstein, Maria Bergman, Vladimir Bykov

In this project, a multi-page React, we've used the API to fetch popular movies in the US using themoviedb.org's API.

## The build and challanges 
We practiced using APIs in React and combining 'useState' and 'useEffect'
The app has  two pages - one showing a list of movies and one showing details
